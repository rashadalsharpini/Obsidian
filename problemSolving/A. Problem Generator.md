```py
for _ in range(int(input())):  
    n, m = map(int, input().split())  
    problems = input()  
    freq = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0, 'D': 0, 'E': 0, 'F': 0, 'G': 0}  
    for char in problems:  
        freq[char] += 1  
    needed_problems = 0  
    for level in 'ABCDEFG':  
        if freq[level] < m:  
            needed_problems += (m - freq[level])  
  
    print(needed_problems)
```

```py
freq = {chr(i): 0 for i in range(ord('A'), ord('Z') + 1)}
```
To solve the problem, let's break down the logic and explanation of the code step by step. The task is to determine the minimum number of problems that Vlad needs to come up with to ensure each round has one problem of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'. Here is a detailed explanation:

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Input Reading**: The code first reads multiple test cases.
2. **Problem Count and Rounds**: For each test case, it reads the number of existing problems and the number of rounds Vlad plans to hold.
3. **Difficulty Levels**: The code reads the string which indicates the difficulty levels of the existing problems.
4. **Frequency Calculation**: It calculates how many problems of each difficulty level are available.
5. **Determine Missing Problems**: It calculates how many more problems of each difficulty level are needed to ensure each round has one of each difficulty level 'A' to 'G'.
6. **Output the Result**: It outputs the minimum number of additional problems required for each test case.

### Code Explanation

python

Copy code

`for _ in range(int(input())):     n, m = map(int, input().split())     problems = input()     freq = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0, 'D': 0, 'E': 0, 'F': 0, 'G': 0}     for char in problems:         freq[char] += 1     needed_problems = 0     for level in 'ABCDEFG':         if freq[level] < m:             needed_problems += (m - freq[level])     print(needed_problems)`

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Read the number of test cases**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `for _ in range(int(input())):`
    
    This loop iterates over the number of test cases.
    
2. **Read `n` and `m` for each test case**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `n, m = map(int, input().split())`
    
    `n` is the number of problems in the bank, and `m` is the number of rounds.
    
3. **Read the string of difficulties**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `problems = input()`
    
    `problems` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
    
4. **Initialize a frequency dictionary for each difficulty level**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `freq = {'A': 0, 'B': 0, 'C': 0, 'D': 0, 'E': 0, 'F': 0, 'G': 0}`
    
5. **Count the frequency of each difficulty level in the input string**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `for char in problems:     freq[char] += 1`
    
    This loop updates the frequency dictionary with the counts of each difficulty level.
    
6. **Calculate the number of additional problems needed**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `needed_problems = 0 for level in 'ABCDEFG':     if freq[level] < m:         needed_problems += (m - freq[level])`
    
    This loop checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.
    
7. **Output the result for each test case**:
    
    python
    
    Copy code
    
    `print(needed_problems)`
    
    This prints the total number of additional problems required for each test case.
    

### Example Walkthrough

#### Test Case 1

- **Input**: `10 1 BGECDCBDED`
- **Frequency**: `{'A': 0, 'B': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 2, 'F': 0, 'G': 1}`
- **Needed Problems**: `A (1), F (1)` → Total: `2`

#### Test Case 2

- **Input**: `10 2 BGECDCBDED`
- **Frequency**: `{'A': 0, 'B': 2, 'C': 2, 'D': 3, 'E': 2, 'F': 0, 'G': 1}`
- **Needed Problems**: `A (2), F (2), G (1)` → Total: `5`

#### Test Case 3

- **Input**: `9 1 BBCDEFFGG`
- **Frequency**: `{'A': 0, 'B': 2, 'C': 1, 'D': 1, 'E': 1, 'F': 2, 'G': 2}`
- **Needed Problems**: `A (1)` → Total: `1`

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently for each test case within the given constraints.
