[problem](https://codeforces.com/contest/1981/problem/A)
The provided code snippet solves the problem by leveraging Python's `bit_length()` method to find the maximum score Piggy can achieve. Let's break down how this works:

### Problem Recap
1. **Turtle's Choice**:
   - Turtle selects an integer \( x \) within the range \([l, r]\).
   - It's given that \( 2l \leq r \).

2. **Piggy's Operations**:
   - Piggy repeatedly divides \( x \) by the largest integer \( p \) such that \( p \geq 2 \) and \( p \mid x \).
   - The score is incremented each time this operation is performed.
   - The goal is to maximize the score.

### Key Insight for the Solution
The optimal choice for maximizing the score is to select \( x \) as the largest power of 2 within the range \([l, r]\). This is because powers of 2 can be divided by 2 multiple times, each division increasing the score by 1.

### Using `bit_length()`
The `bit_length()` method of integers in Python returns the number of bits required to represent the integer in binary. For example:
- \( 5 \) in binary is `101`, so `5.bit_length()` is 3.
- \( 16 \) in binary is `10000`, so `16.bit_length()` is 5.

### How the Code Works
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The outer loop reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( l \) and \( r \).

2. **Finding the Score**:
   - The code uses `r.bit_length() - 1` to determine the maximum score.
   - `r.bit_length()` gives the number of bits needed to represent \( r \). Subtracting 1 gives the highest power of 2 that can be fully represented within that bit length.

### Explanation of the Code
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = map(int, input().split())
    print(r.bit_length() - 1)
```

- `for _ in range(int(input())):`: Reads the number of test cases.
- `l, r = map(int, input().split())`: Reads the values of \( l \) and \( r \) for each test case.
- `print(r.bit_length() - 1)`: Computes and prints the maximum score for each test case.

### Why `r.bit_length() - 1` Works
1. **Finding the Largest Power of 2**:
   - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( r \) is \( 2^{(\text{bit_length}(r) - 1)} \). This is because `bit_length(r) - 1` gives the position of the highest set bit in \( r \).
   - For example, if \( r = 16 \), `16.bit_length()` is 5, so `16.bit_length() - 1` is 4. The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 16 is \( 2^4 = 16 \).

2. **Maximizing Divisions**:
   - By choosing \( x \) as the largest power of 2 within the range, Piggy can perform divisions by 2 repeatedly until \( x \) becomes 1.
   - The number of divisions (i.e., the score) is equal to the exponent of the power of 2. Hence, the score is `r.bit_length() - 1`.

### Summary
The provided code effectively finds the maximum score by determining the highest power of 2 within the range \([l, r]\) and calculating the number of divisions possible, which corresponds to the bit length of \( r \) minus one. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in methods to solve the problem succinctly.
