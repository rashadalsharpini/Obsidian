FIrst we will make dir call myScritpts that we will put in it all of scripts 
now create file call  first.sh
```shell 
touch first.sh
```
if you try to execute the file the permission will denied as the file don't have the rights of execution 
we need to run one of this command to make file executable 
```shell 
chmod u+x first.sh 
chmod 7 first.sh
chmod a+x first.sh
```
the first comman give rights to user to execute 
the secend give user all of right -wrx --> write and read and execute 
third give all rights of execute all--> usr and group and other 
if you don't have knowledge of file permissons read about #FilePermission  

you can execute the file by 
```shell 
./first.sh
```
you can write in file by echo > or open the file by any editor i prefer nvim or vim and 
after that you can start to write your script 

```shell 
#!bin/bash
echo Hello Wordld
echo hello         world
```
output 
```md
Hello World
hello world
```

> [!Note] Note About the last example
> First, note that `echo` puts ONE space between its parameters. Put a few spaces between "Hello" and "World". What do you expect the output to be? What about putting a TAB character between them?  
As always with shell programming, try it and see.  
The output is exactly the same! We are calling the `echo` program with two arguments; it doesn't care any more than `cp` does about the gaps in between them. Now modify the code again:

```shell 
#!/bin/sh  
# This is a comment!  
echo "Hello      World"       # This is a comment, too!
```

```md
This time it works. You probably expected that, too, if you have experience of other programming languages. But the key to understanding what is going on with more complex command and shell script, is to understand and be able to explain: WHY?  
`echo` has now been called with just ONE argument - the string "Hello    World". It prints this out exactly.  
The point to understand here is that the shell parses the arguments BEFORE passing them on to the program being called. In this case, it strips the quotes but passes the string as one argument.  
As a final example, type in the following script. Try to predict the outcome before you run it:
```
[first2.sh](https://www.shellscript.sh/eg/first2.sh.txt)
```shell 
#!/bin/sh
# This is a comment!
echo "Hello      World"	      # This is a comment, too!
echo "Hello World"
echo "Hello * World"
echo Hello * World
echo Hello      World
echo "Hello" World
echo Hello "     " World
echo "Hello "*" World"
echo 'hello' world
```

# 2- Variabels 
>[!Note]
>if i write $ before command ,this is in terminal 

you can read the toutoral to variable [Variabels](https://www.shellscript.sh/variables1.html)
and this is summary to it 
i suppose to read totorual of this 
>[!Note]
>that there must be no spaces around the "`=`" sign: `VAR=value` works; 
>`VAR = value` doesn't work.

```shell
#!/bin/sh  
echo "What is your name?"  
read USER_NAMEecho "Hello $USER_NAME"  
echo "I will create you a file called $USER_NAME_file"  
touch $USER_NAME_file
```

```md
Think about what result you would expect. For example, if you enter "steve" as your USER_NAME, should the script create `steve_file`?  
Actually, no. This will cause an error unless there is a variable called `USER_NAME_file`. The shell does not know where the variable ends and the rest starts. How can we define this?  
The answer is, that we enclose the variable itself in _curly brackets_:
```

```shell
#!/bin/sh  
echo "What is your name?"  
read USER_NAMEecho "Hello $USER_NAME"  
echo "I will create you a file called ${USER_NAME}_file"  
touch "${USER_NAME}_file"
```

```shell
The shell now knows that we are referring to the variable `USER_NAME` and that we want it suffixed with "_file". This can be the downfall of many a new shell script programmer, as the source of the problem can be difficult to track down.

Also note the quotes around `"${USER_NAME}_file"` - if the user entered "Steve Parker" (note the space) then without the quotes, the arguments passed to `touch` would be `Steve` and `Parker_file` - that is, we'd effectively be saying `touch Steve Parker_file`, which is two files to be `touch`ed, not one. The quotes avoid this. 
```

```shell
The first set of variables we will look at are `$0 .. $9` and `$#`.  
The variable `$0` is the _basename_ of the program as it was called.  
`$1 .. $9` are the first 9 additional parameters the script was called with.  
The variable `$@` is all parameters `$1 .. whatever`. The variable `$*`, is similar, but does not preserve any whitespace, and quoting, so "File with spaces" becomes "File" "with" "spaces". This is similar to the `echo` stuff we looked at in [A First Script](https://www.shellscript.sh/first.html). As a general rule, use `$@` and avoid `$*`.  
`$#` is the number of parameters the script was called with.
```

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo "I was called with $# parameters"
echo "My name is $0"
echo "My first parameter is $1"
echo "My second parameter is $2"
echo "All parameters are $@"
```

```shell
first case

$ /home/mohamed/var3.sh
# Ouput
I was called with 0 parameters
My name is /home/mohamed/var3.sh
My first parameter is
My second parameter is    
All parameters are 
$
```

```shell
second case

$ ./var3.sh hello world earth
# Ouput
I was called with 3 parameters
My name is ./var3.sh
My first parameter is hello
My second parameter is world
All parameters are hello world earth
```

Note that `fi` is `if` backwards! This is used again later with [case] and `esac` in switch cases.  
Also, be aware of the syntax - the "`if [ ... ]`" and the "`then`" commands must be on different lines. Alternatively, the semicolon "`;`" can separate them:

if [ ... ]; then
  # do something
fi
```

```shell
You can also use the `elif`, like this:

if  [ something ]; then
 echo "Something"
 elif [ something_else ]; then
   echo "Something else"
 else
   echo "None of the above"
fi
```

  then  # Add spaces after the opening square bracket and before the closing square bracket
    echo "This file already exists."
    exit 1
  else 
    touch $INPUTFILE
    chmod u+x $INPUTFILE
    echo "#!/bin/bash" > $INPUTFILE

		;;
	bye) # if inputt == bye
		echo "See you again!"
		break
		;;
	*) # This equal else 
		echo "Sorry, I don't understand"
		;;
  esac
done
echo 
echo "That's all folks!"
```


# External Programs

External programs are often used within shell scripts; there are a few builtin commands (`echo`, `which`, and `test` are commonly builtin), but many useful commands are actually Unix utilities, such as `tr`, `grep`, `expr` and `cut`.

The backtick (`)is also often associated with external commands. Because of this, we will discuss the backtick first.  
The backtick is used to indicate that the enclosed text is to be executed as a command. This is quite simple to understand. First, use an interactive shell to read your full name from `/etc/passwd`:

```shell
$ grep "^${USER}:" /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f5
Mohamed Elsayed
```

Now we will grab this output into a variable which we can manipulate more easily:

```shell
$ MYNAME=`grep "^${USER}:" /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f5`
$ echo $MYNAME
Mohamed Elsayed
```
# 5- for loop
```shell 
# Syntax 1
#!/bin/bash

for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Looping ... number $i"
done
```

```shell
# Syntax 2
for ((i=0;i<10;i++))
do
  echo "Looping ... i is set to $i"
done

```

```shell
# Syntax 3
for i in {1..10}
do 
  echo "i is : $i"
done
```
## until loop 

```shell
#!/bin/bash

count=1

until [ $count -gt 10 ]  # until the value become greater than 10 he will continue print count and increse it by 1
do
  echo $count
  let count=count+1
done
#--------------------------
# the same result of 
for count in {1..10}
do 
  echo $count
done
#--------------------------
count=1 
while [ $count -le 10 ]
do
  echo $count
  let count=count+1
done
```
# 6- while loop 
```shell 
#!/bin/bash

count=1

while [ $count -le 10 ]
do
  echo $count
  count=$((count+1)) # another synatax to it is --> let count=count +1
  #let count=count+1
done
```

```shell
#!/bin/bash

while true
do
  read -p "Enter a word (or 'quit' to exit): " word
  if [ "$word" = "quit" ]
  then
    break
  fi
  echo "You entered: $word"
done
```

# Functions 
```shell
function print_message {
  echo "Hello, world!"
}

print_message # call function
```

```shell
function add_numbers {    
  local sum=$(($1 + $2))
  echo $sum
}

result=$(add_numbers 5 10) # Take 2 argument and get sum of them
echo "The result is: $result"
```

```shell
function check_number {
  if [[ $1 -gt 10 ]]
  then
    echo "The number is greater than 10"
  else
    echo "The number is less than or equal to 10"
  fi
}

check_number 15
check_number 5
```

```shell
function print_numbers {
  for (( i=1; i<=$1; i++ ))
  do
    echo $i
  done
}

print_numbers 5
```

  cd /home/mohamed/Desktop/obsidianRepo/
  while true

```

To set up a script that randomly sets the desktop background on ArcoLinux with DWM window manager and runs at startup, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and create a new Bash script file using your preferred text editor. For example:

Copy

```
nano random_bg.sh
```

2. Copy and paste the following code into the script file:

bash

Copy

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Set the directory containing the images
IMAGE_DIR="/path/to/image/directory"

# Get a list of the image files in the directory
IMAGE_FILES=$(find "$IMAGE_DIR" -type f -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" -o -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.gif")

# Choose a random image file from the list
RANDOM_IMAGE=$(echo "$IMAGE_FILES" | shuf -n 1)

# Set the desktop background using feh
feh --bg-fill "$RANDOM_IMAGE"
```

Replace `/path/to/image/directory` with the actual path to the directory containing your images.

3. Save and close the script file.
    
4. Make the script file executable:
    

Copy

```sh
chmod +x random_bg.sh
```

5. Open the `.xinitrc` file in your home directory using your preferred text editor:

Copy

```sh
nvim ~/.xinitrc
```

6. Add the following line to the end of the file:

Copy

```
/path/to/random_bg.sh &
```

Replace `/path/to/random_bg.sh` with the actual path to the script file.

7. Save and close the `.xinitrc` file.
    
8. Log out of your user session (or reboot the system).
    
9. At the login screen, select "Xfce4 Session" from the Session menu.
    
10. Enter your username and password to log in.
    
11. DWM should start automatically, and the random background script should run and set the desktop background to a random image from the specified directory.
    

That's it! You should now have a script that sets the desktop background randomly on ArcoLinux with DWM, and it should run automatically at startup.
