### 1. Soft (Symbolic) Links

A symbolic (soft) link is similar to a shortcut, pointing to the original file or directory. It's useful when linking across different filesystems or when you need a link that can remain even if the target is deleted.

- **Command**: 
	`ln -s [target] [link_name]`
- **Example**:
    `ln -s /path/to/original_file /path/to/link_name`
- **Behavior**:
    - Symbolic links can link to directories.
    - If the original file is deleted, the link breaks.
    - Works across different filesystems.

### 2. Hard Links

A hard link is a direct reference to the inode of the original file. Both the original and the hard link point to the same data blocks on disk, so editing one will affect the other. However, hard links cannot span across different filesystems and can only link to files, not directories.

- **Command**: 
	`ln [target] [link_name]`
- **Example**:
    `ln /path/to/original_file /path/to/link_name`
- **Behavior**:
    - The file remains accessible via any hard link, even if the original name is deleted.
    - They donâ€™t work across different filesystems.
    - Cannot link to directories (for security and integrity reasons).

### When to Use

- **Symbolic links** are ideal when you need flexibility, like linking across partitions or linking directories.
- **Hard links** are better when you need multiple names for the same data without breaking if one name is removed.

Each link type serves specific purposes based on your filesystem setup and requirements.
