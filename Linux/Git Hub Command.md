- `git checkout {branch name}`: Switches to the specified branch.
- `git merge {branch name}`: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
- `git status`: Lists the current status of the repository.

These are just a few of the many commands available in Git and GitHub. For more information, consult the official documentation or search for online tutorials and guides. Happy coding!
