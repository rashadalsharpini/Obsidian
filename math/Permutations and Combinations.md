### permutations
- is associated with arranging in different order the order matters
### combinations
- is associated with combining things the order doesn't matter

---
*example*
ABC
CAB
we have same letters but there order is different
- these are two different permutations
- but the same combinations 
p = 2, c = 1
ABCD

| AB  | BA  | CA  | DA  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC  | BC  | CB  | DB  |
| AD  | BD  | CD  | DC  |

p = 12
c = 6 
#### permutations calculations
$$nPr$$$$4P2$$

$$n!/(n-r)!$$
$$4!/(4-2)!$$
4 because 4 letters
2 because 2 out of 4
#### combinations calculations

$$nCr$$
$$4C2$$
$$n!/((n-r)!r!)$$
$$nCr=nPr/r!$$
>[!rule]
>$$nPn = n!$$
>$$nP1 = n$$
