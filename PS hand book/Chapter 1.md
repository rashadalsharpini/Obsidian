#### run program
```bash
# compile code
g++ main.cpp -o main
# run code
./main
```

#### Input and Output
Input and Output is sometimes a bottleneck in the program. The following 
lines at the beginning of the code make input and output more efficient.
```cpp
#define fastio                           \
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);           \
	cin.tie(NULL);
```

Note that the newline "\n" works faster than endl, because endl always
causes a flush operation.

---

if the amount of date is unknown, the following loop could be useful
```cpp
while(cin >> x)
	//code
```
This loop reads elements from the input one after another, until there is no more date available in the input.
#### Integers
The most used integer type in competitive programming is int, which is a 32-bit
type with a value range of *[-2^{31} to 2^{31}-1] or about [-2.10^9 to 2.10^9]*
if the type int is not enough, the 64-bit type long long can be used it has a 
value range of *[-2^{63} to 2^{63} - 1] -1 or about [-9.10^{18} to 9.10^{18}]*
g++ compiler also provides a 128-bit `__int128_t`
with a value range of *[-2^{127} to 2^{127} - 1] or about [-10^{38} to 10^{38}]*.
However, this type is not available in all contest systems.

####odular arithmetic
```cpp
int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
```
Sometimes, the answer to a problem is a very large number but it is enough to output it "modulo m".

#### Mathematics
Sum formulas
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^k $$
$$\sum_{i=1}^n x = 1+2+3+....+n=n(n+1)/2$$
$$\sum_{x=1}^n x^2 = 1^2+2^2+3^2+...+n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1) / 6$$
