#Encryption
**Symmetric** and **asymmetric encryption** are two fundamental types of encryption that differ in key usage and structure:

### Symmetric Encryption

- **Key Usage**: Uses the **same key** for both encryption and decryption.
- **Speed**: Generally faster and more efficient due to simpler algorithms.
- **Key Management**: Key distribution can be a challenge, as both parties need to securely share the key beforehand.
- **Common Algorithms**: AES, DES, Blowfish.
- **Use Cases**: Encrypting large amounts of data (e.g., files, databases).

### Asymmetric Encryption

- **Key Usage**: Uses a **pair of keys**: a **public key** for encryption and a **private key** for decryption.
- **Speed**: Typically slower due to more complex algorithms.
- **Key Management**: Easier key distribution, as the public key can be shared openly while the private key remains secret.
- **Common Algorithms**: RSA, ECC, DSA.
- **Use Cases**: Secure communications, digital signatures, and establishing secure connections (e.g., SSL/TLS).

### Summary

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption, faster but requires secure key sharing.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Public/private key pair, slower but simplifies secure communication and key distribution.
