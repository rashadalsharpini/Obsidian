**Encryption** and **hashing** are both techniques for securing data, but they serve different purposes and work in fundamentally different ways:

### #Encryption

- **Purpose**: Encryption is used to secure data so that it can be safely transmitted or stored and then **decrypted back to its original form** when needed.
- **Process**: Encryption algorithms transform plaintext data into an unreadable format, known as ciphertext, using an encryption key. Decryption requires a key to convert the ciphertext back to the original data.
- **Types**: There are two main types of encryption:
    - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES).
    - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA).
- **Use Cases**: Encryption is commonly used in secure data transmission (e.g., SSL/TLS for web security), storage (e.g., disk encryption), and messaging applications.

### Hashing

- **Purpose**: Hashing is designed to generate a unique, fixed-size hash value (digest) from data and is primarily used for **data integrity verification**. Hashing is a one-way function, meaning it cannot be reversed to retrieve the original data.
- **Process**: A hashing algorithm takes an input and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which appears random. Even small changes in input produce a very different hash output.
- **Common Hash Algorithms**: Examples include MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-3.
- **Use Cases**: Hashing is used in password storage (storing only hashes, not plaintext passwords), data integrity checks (e.g., file verification), and digital signatures.

### Key Differences

- **Reversibility**: Encryption is reversible with the proper key; hashing is a one-way function and cannot be reversed.
- **Purpose**: Encryption secures data for confidentiality, while hashing verifies data integrity and uniqueness.
- **Output**: Encryption produces variable-length ciphertexts (depending on data length), while hashing produces fixed-length digests.

In summary, **encryption** is for confidentiality with reversible transformations, whereas **hashing** is for integrity and verification with irreversible transformations.
