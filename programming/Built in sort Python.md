1. **`a.sort()`**:
    
    - **In-place Sorting**: This method sorts the list `a` in place and returns `None`.
    - **Time Complexity**: The underlying algorithm is Timsort, which has a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)O(nlogn) in the average and worst cases. Timsort is optimized for real-world data and performs particularly well on partially ordered datasets.
    - **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(1)O(1) auxiliary space, since it sorts the list in place.
2. **`sorted(a)`**:
    
    - **Out-of-place Sorting**: This function returns a new list that is the sorted version of `a`, leaving the original list `a` unmodified.
    - **Time Complexity**: Similarly, it uses Timsort, with a time complexity of 𝑂(𝑛log⁡𝑛)O(nlogn) in the average and worst cases.
    - **Space Complexity**: 𝑂(𝑛)O(n) auxiliary space, since it creates a new list.
